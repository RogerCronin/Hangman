# Hangman

My own rework of Coolmath Game's Hangman. Also technically my senior project in high school, but not really. I originally created it because Coolmath Games was blocked by my high school's wifi (can you believe it? insanity). The only thing this version retains is the word list (with minor additions) and the same general game loop.

Instead of three difficulty settings, I opted to make casual and competitive gamemodes with a weekly leaderboard. The server is hosted for free on [replit.com](https://replit.com/@RogerCronin1/SquareBracketsAPI). Please don't hack it üôè.

For my senior project, I collected user data over the course of two weeks and performed "statistical analysis" on it. It's a wonder I graduated with that presentation. You can find some of my code [here](https://github.com/RogerCronin/hangman-analysis). I'm actually sort of proud of it, in a weird, nostalgic way. I wish the Google Slides wasn't deleted when I went off to university...
